My name is Donghyun Kang, and my preferred nickname is Daniel. 

I have a Ph.D. degree in engineering and specialized in digital signal processing for random processes, and led multiple R&D projects for more than 10 years with an end to end process - from strategic planning to product test. 

I have strong points not only on an EDA for extracting statistics of data but also on the application of ML algorithms. Currently I'm working for Prudential Financial as a Sr. Data Scientist to deliver POCs and ML MVPs to business partners and actuarial teams using internal and external data as described in below.

- Analyzing Data with business partners on product design rules, sales pattern, customer's preference on the products, and significant statistics for target marketing and ideation on new products  ( Rule based analysis, Unsupervised and Semi/Self-supervised learning)
- Developing Machine learning models for business use cases based on time series analysis, mortality analysis, products design, and customer churn analysis (Predictive modeling for policy persistency, new product opportunity, and reinsurance)
- Providing Dashboards on Analytical results and insights (using MS Power BI)
- Cooperating with DevOps teams to deploy models
- Researching on concerns and effectiveness of the MDLC(ML model development lifecycle)
